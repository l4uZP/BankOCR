# Bank OCR Kata

I wanted to practice Go so I decided to work in this Kata. Here is the link where I get the problem description and other resources in order to solve it:

[Kata Link](https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/)

I had finished from User story 1 to 3.

User story 4 is still in work...

I haven't refactor my code yet, that's work in progress too.

This README is here just to remind me my progress and the missing things in my code.
